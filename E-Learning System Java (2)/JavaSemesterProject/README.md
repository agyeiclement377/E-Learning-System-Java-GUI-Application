# INTRODUCTION: <br>
E-Learning System is a desktop-based Windows application developed in Java with Swing and AWT. This project aims at serving Students and Teachers in Online based learning. 
Admins can add subjects, Teachers can add courses in a particular subject and Students can Enroll courses and study them, and also Students can message other participants in a particular course except the Teacher teaching that course.

**Hardware and software tools:**<br>
The system services and goals are established by consultation with system user. They are then defined in details and serve as a system specification. System requirement are those on which the system runs.<br><br>

‚öôÔ∏è    Hardware Requirements:<br>
*   Computer with either Intel Pentium processor or AMD processor.<br>
*   1GB+ DDR RAM<br>
*   1GB hard disk drive<br>


üíª    Software Requirements:<br>
*   Windows Operating system.<br>
*   JRE and JDK.<br>	
*   MySQL server (WAMP)<br>

# DESIGN<br>
Database Design is a collection of processes that facilitate the designing, development, implementation and maintenance of enterprise data management systems.<br>
It helps produce database systems:<br>
*   That meet the requirements of the users<br>
*   Have high performance.<br>

**Architecture Description** <br>
The design of a DBMS depends on its architecture. It can be centralized or decentralized or hierarchical. The architecture of a DBMS can be seen as either single tier or multi-tier.<br><br>
